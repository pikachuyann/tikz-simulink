\section{Introduction}
    {\tt simulink.sty} is a \LaTeX{} package that defines new TikZ (or more
exactly, PGF) shapes that depict various Simulink blocks. This package should
allow to draw more precisely Simulink models, and replace the current way of
drawing Simulink models, which is by taking screenshots of Matlab-Simulink.

\section{Currently available Simulink Blocks}
    The following Simulink blocks are currently available in the package :
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        {\bf Block Name} & {\bf Shape Name} & {\bf Default shape} & 
        {\bf Better Shape} \\
        \hline \hline
        Inport & {\tt skInport} & \skBlockO{skInport}{$\ell_1$} & \\
        \hline
        Outport & {\tt skOutport} & \skBlockI{skOutport}{$\ell_1$} & \\
        \hline
        Constant & {\tt skConstant} &
        \skBlockO{skConstant,cstval=$c$}{$\ell_1$} & \\
        \hline
        Add (2-ports) & {\tt skAdd} &
        \skBlockIIO{skAdd}{$\ell_1$}{$\ell_2$}{$\ell_3$} & \\
        \hline
        Unit Delay & {\tt skUnitDelay} &
        \skBlockIO{skUnitDelay}{$\ell_1$}{$\ell_2$} & \\
        \hline
        Delay & {\tt skDelay} &
        \skBlockIO{skDelay,delayval=k}{$\ell_1$}{$\ell_2$} & \\
        \hline
        Zero-Order Hold & {\tt skZeroOrderHold} &
        \skBlockIO{skZeroOrderHold}{$\ell_1$}{$\ell_2$} & \\
        \hline
        Gain & {\tt skGain} & \skBlockIO{skGain}{$\ell_1$}{$\ell_2$} & \\
        \hline
        Integrator & {\tt skIntegrator} &
        \skBlockIO{skIntegrator}{$\ell_1$}{$\ell_2$} & 
        \SKBettertrue
        \skBlockIO{skIntegrator}{$\ell_1$}{$\ell_2$}
        \SKBetterfalse \\
        \hline
        Sine Wave (continuous) & {\tt skSineWave} &
        \skBlockO{skSineWave}{$\ell_1$} & \\
        \hline
        Transport Delay & {\tt skTransportDelay} &
        \skBlockIO{skTransportDelay}{$\ell_1$}{$\ell_2$} & \\
        \hline
        Relay & {\tt skRelay} & \skBlockIO{skRelay}{$\ell_1$}{$\ell_2$} & \\
        \hline
        Switch & {\tt skSwitch} &
        \skBlockIIIO{skSwitch}{$\ell_1$}{$\ell_2$}{$\ell_3$}{$\ell_4$} & \\
        \hline
        Scope & {\tt skScope} & \skBlockI{skScope}{$\ell_1$} & \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

    Some of the blocks have shapes that are difficult to recognize for someone
    not used to Simulink. For that matter, an option, named
    \texttt{BetterShape}, has been added to \texttt{simulink.sty} so that
    blocks display in a more understandable shape.

\section{An example of Simulink model drawn through TikZ}
\begin{center}
    \input{Figures/Delay_and_Add.tex}
    \captionof{figure}{A small Simulink model} \label{DelayAndAdd}
\end{center}
    One might draw the Simulink model shown in figure \ref{DelayAndAdd} by
writing the following \LaTeX{} code :
