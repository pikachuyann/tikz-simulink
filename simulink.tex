\section{Introduction}
    {\tt simulink.sty} is a \LaTeX{} package that defines new TikZ (or more
exactly, PGF) shapes that depict various Simulink blocks. This package should
allow to draw more precisely Simulink models, and replace the current way of
drawing Simulink models, which is by taking screenshots of Matlab-Simulink.

\section{Currently available Simulink Blocks}
    The following Simulink blocks are currently available in the package :
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        {\bf Block Name} & {\bf Shape Name} & {\bf Default shape} \\
        \hline \hline
        Inport & {\tt skInport} & \skBlockO{skInport}{$\ell_1$} \\
        \hline
        Outport & {\tt skOutport} & \skBlockI{skOutport}{$\ell_1$} \\
        \hline
        Constant & {\tt skConstant} & \skBlockO{skConstant,cstval=$c$}{$\ell_1$} \\
        \hline
        Add (2-ports) & {\tt skAdd} & \skBlockIIO{skAdd}{$\ell_1$}{$\ell_2$}{$\ell_3$} \\
        \hline
        Unit Delay & {\tt skUnitDelay} & \skBlockIO{skUnitDelay}{$\ell_1$}{$\ell_2$} \\
        \hline
        Sine Wave (continuous) & {\tt skSineWave} & \skBlockO{skSineWave}{$\ell_1$} \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{An example of Simulink model drawn through TikZ}
\begin{center}
    \input{Figures/Delay_and_Add.tex}
    \captionof{figure}{A small Simulink model} \label{DelayAndAdd}
\end{center}
    One might draw the Simulink model shown in figure \ref{DelayAndAdd} by
writing the following \LaTeX{} code :
